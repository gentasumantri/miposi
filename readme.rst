MIPOSI - Mikrotik Portal Simulation

Honestly, it's not a Mikrotik Hotspot Simulation. it's just an App that i'am build as a request from my client's.

. This App created based on Mikrotik ROS v6.44.3 template
. I'am using Regex to convert the Mikrotik function to PHP function (not perfect, but it works)
. So if your template don't fit so well, just edit the Regex Pattern. (carefully)
