Honestly, it's not a Mikrotik Hotspot Simulation. it's just an App that I'am build to demonstrate my template online.
My client was want to see my work like its live, so i build this.


INFO :

. This App created based on Mikrotik ROS v6.44.3 template
. I'am using Regex to convert the Mikrotik function to PHP function (not perfect, but it works)
. So if your template don't fit so well, just edit the Regex Pattern. (carefully)
. You can create your own Regex at <root_folder>/application/controllers/Add.php
. Username = admin
. Password = admin
. Remember this is a PHP file, you can costumize to your own need.


HOW TO :

1. Copy your template folder to '<root_folder>/view/<place_your_template_here>'
2. Then navigate to <your_domain>/add/files/<your_template_folder>
3. It will automatically convert your Login.html, Status.html, and Logout.html to .php files.
4. Now look your template at <your_domain>/demo/mikrotik/<your_template_folder>
5. Just in case you have multi-language template, juat add your sub-folder too!.
6. Example : <your_domain>/add/files/<your_template_folder>/<your_subfolder_language

some advice : try to add index.html to all sub-folder in your template.
